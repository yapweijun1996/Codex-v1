# AI Chart Summary Application Cookbook

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the AI Chart Summary application, covering its features, how to use them, and underlying technical details.

## 1. Overview

The AI Chart Summary application is a powerful web-based tool designed to help users analyze CSV data efficiently. It allows for quick parsing of CSV files, automatic profiling and aggregation of data, generation of interactive charts and data tables, and management of analysis sessions through a history feature. It also integrates with AI models (like Gemini) for potential future enhancements, though the current implementation focuses on data visualization and manipulation.

## 2. Core Functionality

The application streamlines the process of transforming raw CSV data into actionable insights through several key steps:

*   **CSV Parsing**: Reads and interprets CSV files, handling various delimiters and header configurations.
*   **Data Profiling**: Automatically identifies column types (number, string, date, empty) and calculates uniqueness and completeness metrics.
*   **Data Aggregation**: Groups data based on selected dimensions and performs calculations (sum, average, count, min, max, distinct count) on metrics.
*   **Chart Generation**: Visualizes aggregated data using various chart types (bar, line, area, pie, doughnut, polar area, radar) powered by Chart.js.
*   **Interactive Data Tables**: Displays raw and aggregated data in sortable, searchable, and paginated tables.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1. CSV Upload & Parsing

The application supports loading CSV or TXT files from your local system.

*   **File Input**: The application can be initiated in two ways: 1) By receiving a `postMessage` with CSV data from an integrated ERP report (e.g., from `inc_report_main_heading.cfm`). 2) By manually selecting a file through the hidden [`<input id="file" type="file">`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:1103) element, which is intended for development and testing.
*   **Delimiter Detection**: Automatically detects the most suitable delimiter (comma, semicolon, tab, pipe) or allows manual selection via [`<select id="delimiter">`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:1112).
*   **Header Row**: Option to specify if the first row contains headers via [`<input id="hasHeader" type="checkbox">`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:1120).
*   **Date Format**: Auto-detects or allows manual selection of date formats (dd/mm/yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy, yyyy-mm-dd) for accurate date parsing via [`<select id="dateFormat">`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:1125).
*   **BOM Handling**: Automatically strips Byte Order Mark (BOM) from CSV files for consistent parsing.

**Code Reference:**
*   [`parseCSV()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:2083) function in `fr_ai_chart.cfm`
*   [`ai_chart_parser_worker.js`](ai_chart_parser_worker.js) for background parsing.

### 3.2. Data Profiling

After loading a CSV, the application profiles each column to understand its characteristics.

*   **Column Type Inference**: Determines if a column contains numbers, dates, strings, or is empty.
*   **Uniqueness & Completeness**: Calculates the number of unique values and the percentage of non-empty cells for each column.
*   **Schema Display**: Presents a summary of the detected schema in the "Schema / Parser Info" section.

**Code Reference:**
*   [`profile()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:2387) function in `fr_ai_chart.cfm`
*   [`inferType()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:2380) function in `fr_ai_chart.cfm`

### 3.3. Auto vs. Manual Mode for Aggregation

The application offers two modes for data aggregation:

*   **Auto Mode (Default)**: Uses intelligent heuristics and ERP-specific logic to automatically infer column roles (metric, dimension, date, ID, ignore) and generate a set of relevant aggregate charts. This mode prioritizes common business metrics like 'Amount', 'Price', and 'Quantity'.
*   **Manual Mode**: Provides granular control, allowing users to explicitly define column roles and create custom aggregations.

**Code Reference:**
*   [`switchMode()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:4558) function
*   [`autoPlan()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:3083) function for auto-detection logic.
*   [`buildErpPlan()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:3016) for ERP-specific planning.
*   [`planFromManualRoles()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:4440) for manual mode planning.

### 3.4. Column Role Management (Manual Mode)

In manual mode, users can override the automatically detected column roles.

*   **Role Editor Modal**: Accessed via the "Edit column roles" button, this modal allows users to assign roles to each column:
    *   **metric**: Numeric columns for calculations (sum, avg, count).
    *   **dimension**: Categorical columns for grouping data.
    *   **date**: Time-based fields for time series analysis.
    *   **id**: Unique identifiers (excluded from aggregations).

*   **Metric Priority**: The auto-charting feature prioritizes common ERP metrics like 'Amount', 'Price', and 'Quantity' when deciding which columns to aggregate.
*   **Column Role Inference**: The application uses a set of patterns to identify common ERP column types, such as `partyCode`, `stockCode`, and `currency`.
*   **Auto-Plan**: The `buildErpPlan()` function creates a set of default charts based on the detected ERP columns, such as "Amount by Customer" or "Quantity by Product".

**Code Reference:**
*   [`getMetricPriority()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:1900)
*   [`buildErpPlan()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:3016)
*   [`findErpCandidates()`](fr_ai_chart.cfm:2993)

### 3.13. Exporting Data (from `inc_report_main_heading.cfm`)

The `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` file, typically used for ERP reports, includes functionality to export the displayed report data.

*   **Export to Excel**: Converts the HTML table content into an Excel-compatible format. It includes logic to handle large file sizes and cross-browser compatibility.
*   **Export to CSV**: Converts the HTML table content into a CSV format. It includes logic for handling multi-page reports and two-header displays.
*   **AI Chart Button**: A special button (`openAiTableBtn`) that extracts the current report's table data and sends it to `fr_ai_chart.cfm` (this application) for further analysis and charting. This is a key integration point.

**Code Reference:**
*   [`ExportExcel()`](inc_report_main_heading.cfm:619) function
*   [`ExportCSV()`](inc_report_main_heading.cfm:856) function
*   `openAiTableBtn` event listener and `tableToCsv()` function in `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` (lines 1557-1687).

## 4. Technical Details / Architecture

### 4.1. Frontend Technologies

*   **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3**: Styling, including responsive design, modern UI elements (cards, sections, tooltips, toasts), and a custom color palette.
*   **JavaScript (ES Modules)**: Core logic, DOM manipulation, event handling, data processing, and API interactions.
*   **Chart.js v4**: A popular JavaScript charting library used for rendering various types of interactive charts.
*   **PapaParse**: A robust CSV parser for handling large CSV files efficiently.
*   **marked.js**: A markdown parser used for rendering AI-generated explanations.
*   **jQuery**: Used in `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` for DOM manipulation and cross-browser compatibility.

### 4.2. Data Storage

*   **IndexedDB (`ai_chart_store.js`)**: Client-side database used for persistent storage of user's report history. This includes metadata about the reports and the actual CSV data, which is stored in chunks to handle large files.

### 4.3. Performance Optimization

*   **Web Workers (`ai_chart_parser_worker.js`)**: Heavy computational tasks like CSV parsing and data aggregation are offloaded to a Web Worker. This prevents the main browser thread from freezing, ensuring a smooth user experience even with large datasets.
*   **Debouncing**: Input events (like search and auto-save) are debounced to limit the frequency of expensive operations.
*   **Chart.js Optimizations**: Uses `update('none')` for snappier redraws without animation and `decimation` for line charts with many points.
*   **Masonry Layout**: Dynamically adjusts card heights in the "Aggregates" grid for optimal visual presentation.

### 4.4. Backend (Implied)

*   **ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)**: The `.cfm` files suggest a ColdFusion backend environment. `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` is a server-side include that generates parts of the HTML and JavaScript, indicating that the application might be part of a larger ERP or reporting system.

### 4.5. UI/UX Enhancements

*   **Tooltips**: Provides helpful context for various UI elements.
*   **Modals**: Used for column role editing, adding aggregates, history management, and AI settings.
*   **Toasts**: Non-intrusive notifications for user feedback (e.g., "CSV data loaded successfully").
*   **Collapsible Sections**: Allows users to hide/show sections of the report for better focus.
*   **Accessibility (A11y)**: Includes ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support for improved usability.

## 5. Integration Points

The primary integration point is between `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` (likely part of an existing ERP system) and `fr_ai_chart.cfm` (this application).

*   **`openAiTableBtn`**: When clicked in the ERP report, this button in `inc_report_main_heading.cfm` collects all visible HTML table data, converts it to CSV, and sends it via `window.postMessage` to a newly opened `fr_ai_chart.cfm` tab.
*   **`window.addEventListener('message')`**: In `fr_ai_chart.cfm`, this listener receives the CSV data from the ERP report, processes it, and then renders the charts and tables.

This allows users to seamlessly transition from a standard ERP report to an interactive data analysis and charting environment.
