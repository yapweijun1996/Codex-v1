# Skill Manager

This skill provides introspection capabilities. You can use it to discover what other skills are installed and read their documentation to learn how to use them.

## When to use
- When the user asks a question and you don't know the answer.
- When you need to find an API URL but don't know it.
- **Workflow**: `list_available_skills` -> Find relevant skill -> `read_skill_documentation` -> Learn API -> `run_javascript`.
